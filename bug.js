This React Native code snippet demonstrates a potential issue with accessing state values within an asynchronous function. The problem arises when the component re-renders before the asynchronous operation completes, resulting in stale closure values.  Consider the following code:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
      const jsonData = await response.json();
      setData(jsonData);
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      {data ? (
        <Text>{data.someValue}</Text>
      ) : (
        <Text>Loading...</Text>
      )}
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

If the `fetchData` function takes longer than expected, and the component re-renders before it completes, the `data` variable inside the `fetchData` function might refer to a stale closure value, leading to unexpected behavior.  This is particularly noticeable in functions that are called asynchronously.
